			  <h1 > NEW YORK CITY'S HOMELESS CRISIS: THE SOCIAL ISSUE </h1>

			  	<h3> END HOMELESSNESS IN NEW YORK CITY</h3>

			  			<p> New york state is the largest state in the united states. New York even ranks in the top 30 of the largest states in the world. 

			  			<br> With almost half of it's residents residing in New York City. This mass population of people makes for a serious housing issue. 
			  			<br> The lack of affordable housing around the city has left many families, veterans and children homeless.</p>

			  	 		<p> Homelessness is a social issue that effects everyone in society wheter we like it or not. <br>
			  	 		It affects us all beacuse we are constanlty interacting with the homeless both directly and indirectly. <br>
			  	 		 Many homneles people are forced to live on the streets on NYC becaue of the lack of available beds in the cities shelters. <br>
			  	 		 Despite stereotypes anyone can become homeless. Like this veteran I photographed near 42nd street, Bryant Park.

			  	 		<p>There are many problems homeless people face. Like poor living conditions in local shelters. <br>
			  	 		 Which force some homeless individulas to the resort of sleeping on the MTA to even these conditions. </p>

						<p> I have perosonally witnessed the homeless sleeping in. the back of subway cars while commuting on the MTA. <br> 
						This is very problematic because it demnonstrates New York's blatant lack of accountabilty and solution for this social issue. <br>
						It also is both dangerous and inconvient for MTA riders who commute to work and are exposed to these types of siuations daily.</p>

			  			<p> Times square 42nd street is one of New York Citys most popular areas. It also houses a large homeless population that are often ignored.<br> They migrate to these popular areas where they pick a spot and sit there all day with a sign. </p>

			  			<p> This is the unglamourous side of New York City that the media does not show you about New York. <br>
			  			The truth is housing is a huge problem for most people living in New York City right now. <br>
			  			Yet it is still unadressed and contributes to the annual homelessness growth rate.<br>
			  			 Although anyone of any race can become homeless. Mostly minorities are affected by it. <br>Minorities make up more than half of New York Citys homeless population.

			  			<p> Research supports the posotive corelation of linking individulas with mental health issues. <br>
			  			To people who have been exposed to homelessness. <br> These people are more likey to develop a mental health disorder.</p>

			  			<p> Some homeless individuals are homeless solely beacuse of their mental health issues. <br>
			  			 Many of New York's homeless population suffer from undiagnosed mental illnesses. <br>
			  			  The lack of treament causes them to not be able to function in society.<br> These people often become severely disturbed.<br>
			  			   Spending most of their lives living on the streets of NYC. </p>

			  			<p> Not only are the homeless people facing mental health issues but, they are often at higher risk to develop serious drug addictions.<br> Some homeless youth and adults are using drugs as coping mechanisms. <br>
			  			A few common store bought drugs that homeless people have access to are beer, alcohol and cigarettes.<br>
			  			 There is also an illegal market of hard drugs that homeless people are able to gain access to as well.<br>
			  			These are known as hardcore drugs. Like crack, cocaine, heroine and crystal meth.</p>
